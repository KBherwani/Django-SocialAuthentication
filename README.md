SOCIAL AUTHENTICATION USING DJANGO

This Project looks at how to add social auth (also known as social login or social signon) to a Django application with Django Allauth. 
You can also configure GitHub and Twitter auth as well as regular auth with username and password.

Using a social auth has its advantages. 
You won't need to set up auth for the web application, since it's handled by the third-party, OAuth provider.
Also, since providers like Google, Facebook, and GitHub perform extensive checks to prevent unauthorized access to their services,
leveraging social auth instead of rolling your own auth mechanism can boost your application's security.

This Project contains a proper setup of socail authetication
